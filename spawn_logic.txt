Idea 1:
create masterlist of lists of each enemy type and then inside the enemy type list are lists of the enemy object
and its correlated meteor object

loop through (depending on the wave) the master list to loop through the lists of enemy types, and then use a nested loop
to add the corresponding amount of enemies and meteors depending on the wave.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
ex.

for wave 1:
create a sublist of 3 green alien objects and spawn them buffered
once each alien is dead, delete from the list.
for wave 2:
create 5 green aliens
wave 3:
7 aliens
wave 4:
9 aliens
wave 5:
9 green aliens in the sublist and add 1 blue alien (consider meteor size as well) to a sublist for that enemy type.
etc.
